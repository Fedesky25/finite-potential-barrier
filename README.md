# Finite potential barrier
Part of a Physics 2 assignement that involves the study of a wave function in 1D where a potential barrier is present.
In order to achieve the task, here's a Svelte page to visualize the trasmission coefficient in dependece of:
- barrier width
- barrier potential
- particle energy
